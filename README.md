## 1. Meta-Prompt
```
You are given a base prompt that defines a voice agent's behavior and objectives. Analyze this base prompt to identify all possible conversation outcomes, then generate a tagging prompt that classifies call transcripts into these outcomes.
Follow these steps:
1. Identify the main call objective and what constitutes success/failure
2. Consider categories such as: Primary Success, Partial Success, Clear Rejection, Technical Issues, Incomplete Conversations, and Edge Cases
3. Create 6-8 specific, mutually exclusive outcomes that cover all scenarios
4. Generate a tagging prompt with clear objective, outcome definitions, and classification rules
5. Handle cultural communication patterns (Indian politeness, Hindi-English code-switching) by folding them into appropriate broader categories
6. Ensure outcomes are actionable for business decisions
Output a complete tagging prompt that returns only the outcome name in ALL_CAPS format.
```

## 3. Example Generated Outcome Tagging Prompts
### Tagging Prompt for Base Prompt 1: Feedback Collection
```
Classify this feedback collection call transcript into exactly one outcome.
OBJECTIVE: Collect customer feedback and ratings about their ABC Stays property experience.
OUTCOME DEFINITIONS:
POSITIVE_RATING_GIVEN: Customer provided rating of 4-5 or expressed satisfaction with their stay
NEGATIVE_RATING_GIVEN: Customer provided rating of 1-3 or expressed dissatisfaction  
FEEDBACK_DECLINED: Customer explicitly refused to provide feedback or participate
CALLBACK_REQUESTED: Customer was busy/unavailable and asked to be called back later
MIXED_RESPONSE: Customer gave contradictory signals or uncertain/ambiguous responses
VOICEMAIL_NO_CONTACT: Call went to voicemail, automated message, or technical issues
INCOMPLETE_CONVERSATION: Feedback process started but was not completed for any reason
CLASSIFICATION RULES:
1. Prioritize explicit numerical ratings (1-5) over general comments
2. Consider cultural politeness - "OK" may not indicate satisfaction
3. Handle Hindi-English code-switching by focusing on content meaning
4. If multiple outcomes apply, choose the most specific and actionable one
5. Very short conversations (≤3 exchanges) are typically incomplete or technical issues
SPECIAL CASES:
- Voicemail phrases: "record your message", "not available" → VOICEMAIL_NO_CONTACT
- Explicit refusal: "don't want to give feedback" → FEEDBACK_DECLINED  
- Contradictory responses: positive rating but negative comments → MIXED_RESPONSE
Return only the outcome name in ALL_CAPS format.
```
### Tagging Prompt for Base Prompt 2: Lead Qualification
```
Classify this lead qualification call transcript into exactly one outcome.
OBJECTIVE: Assess student interest in sports management program and qualify for enrollment.
OUTCOME DEFINITIONS:
CLEARLY_INTERESTED: Student expressed interest, asked questions, or showed engagement with program
NOT_INTERESTED: Student explicitly declined interest or said not interested  
CALLBACK_SCHEDULED: Student showed interest AND scheduled follow-up with admissions team
ALREADY_COMMITTED: Student mentioned existing enrollment, job, or competing commitments
REQUESTED_CALLBACK: Student was busy but open to future discussion at specific time
VOICEMAIL_NO_CONTACT: Call went to voicemail, automated message, or no human interaction
INCOMPLETE_QUALIFICATION: Started qualification process but didn't complete interest assessment
CLASSIFICATION RULES:
1. Focus on explicit interest/disinterest statements over neutral responses
2. Scheduled callbacks indicate stronger interest than general enthusiasm  
3. Recognize Indian cultural politeness - apparent agreement may mask disinterest
4. "Maybe later" or "we'll think about it" often indicates polite decline
5. Family approval references indicate consideration process, not immediate decision
SPECIAL CASES:
- Direct rejection: "not interested", "no thank you" → NOT_INTERESTED
- Polite deflection: "maybe later", soft refusal → NOT_INTERESTED
- Competing priorities: "already doing MBA" → ALREADY_COMMITTED
Return only the outcome name in ALL_CAPS format.
```
### Tagging Prompt for Base Prompt 3: Retention Calling
```

OBJECTIVE: Understand customer experience with Urea Foot Roll On and encourage repurchase.
OUTCOME DEFINITIONS:
POSITIVE_EXPERIENCE: Customer expressed satisfaction, product worked well, or positive feedback
NEGATIVE_EXPERIENCE: Customer reported problems, dissatisfaction, or product didn't work
PURCHASED_ELSEWHERE: Customer bought product from competitor (Amazon, Nykaa, etc.)

REQUESTED_CALLBACK: Customer was busy/unavailable and asked to be called back
VOICEMAIL_NO_CONTACT: Call went to voicemail, automated message, or technical issues
CLASSIFICATION RULES:
1. Product experience assessment takes priority over purchase behavior
2. Success paradox: positive experience leading to discontinued use is separate outcome
3. Distinguish between price-driven vs convenience-driven competitor purchases

5. Consider customer lifecycle - problem resolution may eliminate product need
SPECIAL CASES:
- Product success: "worked great, don't need it anymore" → PRODUCT_NO_LONGER_NEEDED  
- Platform switching: mentions Nykaa, Amazon purchases → PURCHASED_ELSEWHERE
- Polite refusal: indirect decline patterns → DECLINED_DISCUSSION
Return only the outcome name in ALL_CAPS format.
